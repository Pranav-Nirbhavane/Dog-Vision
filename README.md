# **üê∂ End-to-End Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification**

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

## **1. Problem**

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

When I'm siting at the cafe andI take photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.

## **2. Data**

The data we are using is from Kaggle's Dog breed identification competition.

## **3. Evaluation**

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabolities for each dog breed of each test image.

## **4. Features**

Some information about the data:
* We are dealing with images (unstructured data) so its probably we use deep learning/ transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).
